# cs371-Music-Suggestion

## Problem
Our project explores song classification and recommendation using KRR approaches instead of the more common
statistical (i.e. machine learning) methods. In particular, we reason for recommendation based on mood, reasonable
dance style, and energy. We compute the mood by implementing a classification system adapted from research by
[Michael Nuzzolo](https://sites.tufts.edu/eeseniordesignhandbook/2015/music-mood-classification/) in companions.
